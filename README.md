**Pylda** is a mini adventure game project inspired by *The Legend of Zelda*, built using **Python** and **Pygame**.

⚠️ This is **not a complete or commercial game** — it's a personal learning project to practice game development and improve my understanding of Pygame.

- 🧙 Custom UI for health, energy, EXP, and upgrades
- 🗡️ Real-time combat mechanics (weapons and spells)
- 🎨 Integrating pixel art graphics and animations
- 🔉 Adding sound effects and transitions
- 🧪 Structuring a modular Pygame project
